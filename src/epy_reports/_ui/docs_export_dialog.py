"""Dialog for exporting the current document through epy_docs.

Thin: the window itself is the family's, in
``epy_export._ui.docs_export_dialog``. It is the same two combos, the
same directory picker, the same format checkboxes and the same three
remembered keys in all three editors, and only the registry scope and
the translators differ -- so those are what this module supplies.

Both names below keep the shapes this application already imports:
``DocsExportDialog(source_path)`` and ``_RenderWorker(...)``.
