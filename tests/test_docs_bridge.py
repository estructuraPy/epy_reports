"""The bridge to ePy Docs, which no longer reaches it directly.

``epy_export`` owns the engine catalog, the availability route and the
render; this module speaks epy_reports' vocabulary to it. The tests
therefore state what the bridge PROMISES rather than which library call
it happens to make, because the previous set asserted the internals --
that it patched ``importlib.util.find_spec`` inside this module, and
that listing the layouts raised when the engine was absent -- and both
of those are exactly what had to change.

Pure Python: no Qt required.
